# Chapter3-DataScience
in this chapter, we should use the data set to analyze the data and make some prediction models.

## Background
HR professionals generally lag behind with respect to analytics and data visualization competency. Thus, Dr. Carla Patalano set out to create their own HR-related dataset, which is used in one of the graduate MSHRM courses called HR Metrics and Analytics, at New England College of Business. He created this data set.

## Dataset
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rietaros/kampus_merdeka/main/HRDataset_v14.csv


## Task
1. Answer multiple aggregations questions using Pandas. (please refer to .ipynb for detailed questions)
2. Perform EDA on the target to find out how many feature variables are related to the termination of an employee's employment. (Most reasons, by department, by gender, etc.) Create data visualization according to EDA Steps (minimum 5 visualizations). Give us an insight from this step.
3. Perform Machine Learning modeling to predict employee termination.
4. Answer this question:
    a. Is there any relationship between who a person works for (their manager) and their performance score?
    b. What are our best recruiting sources if we want to ensure a low ratio of termination?

On this project, iam using pandas for processing and manipulate data from dataset, using seaborn for visualization data for seing correlation between every coloumn of dataset, after that, using this dataset to create prediction model machine learning.
